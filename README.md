##### TriggerBot.py:
-This version saves triggers for each group separately.

##### TriggerBot_old.py:
-This version saves triggers globally.

##### TriggerBotTornado.py:
-Same as TriggerBot.py, but runs on top of a tornado webserver.  


##### TriggerBotMarkov.py:
-This version does not store triggers, it stores   messages and tries to generate sentences.

##### TriggerBotSqlite.py:
-Same as TriggerBot.py, but uses a sqlite database to store triggers.
